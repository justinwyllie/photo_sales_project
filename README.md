# photo_sales_project
Backbone.js based add-on to enable photographers to display and sell prints on their web site

The idea is to keep this very simple. Just a few files. No installation routine. No database - the pricing details
are entered into an XML file. 

There *may* be an optional admin panel for those who don't feel comfortable editing XML files. 

Nb. 

Currently the Proof selection section is done as a jQuery 'app' and the Print ordering section as a Backone app - which creates a bit of confusion. Currently porting the whole thing to SPA.
