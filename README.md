# photo_sales_project
Backbone.js based add-on to enable photographers to display and sell prints on their web site. The s/w contains a proofing gallery and a print sales section. The print sales section supports prints, mounts and frames. Payment can be taken by PayPal. 

The idea is to keep this very simple. Just a few files. No installation routine. No database - the pricing details
are entered into an XML file. 

There *may* be an optional admin panel for those who don't feel comfortable editing XML files. 

Nb. 

If you are a photographer and would like to use this licensed software in which the legal copyright is owned by Justin Wyllie on your site please contact me. info - AT - justinwylliephotography.com.
