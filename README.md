# photo_sales_project
Basic jQuery based add-on to enable photographers to display and sell prints on their web site

The idea is to keep this very simple. Just 2 or 3 files. No installation routine. No database - the gallery details
are entered into an XML file. 

There *may* be an aoptional admin panel for those who don't feel comfortable editing XML files.
